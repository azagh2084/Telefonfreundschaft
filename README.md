# Telefonfreundschaft

A website to connect people. 

## Description

This website is being developed as part of the &#35;wirvsvirus hackathon hold by the german gouvernment in response to the corona crisis. 

Humans are social by nature. But one of the biggest problems of this crisis is that to fight the virus we have to cut away most of ways to be social. 
The purpose is to provide a way to connect to people who are in isolation but still want to talk and be social.

Phone calls are one of the only remaining ways to connect to others and with this website we want to bring together those who are willing to provide help by calling other people and those who are alone in isolation. 

Its meant to be easy to use and also provides a way to allow people without internet connection to be registered by phone number on this website. 

## Getting Started

This website is based on plain PHP/HTML5/CSS/JS so all you need is PHP7.3, Apache and MySQL.

<?php

    $mysql_password = 'HIER DAS PASSWORT';
...
```

And also add a MySql database called "wirvsvirus"
