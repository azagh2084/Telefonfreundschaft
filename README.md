# Telefonhelfer

A website to connect people. 

## Description

This website is being developed as part of the &#35;wirvsvirus hackathon hold by the german gouvernment in response to the corona crisis. 

Humans are social by nature. But one of the biggest problems of this crisis is that to fight the virus we have to cut away most of ways to be social. 
The purpose is to provide a way to connect to people who are in isolation but still want to talk to other people. 

Phone calls are one of the only remaining ways to connect to other 
people and with this website we want to bring together people who are willing to call other people and people who want to talk to people. 

Its meant to be easy to use and also provides a way to allow people without internet connection to be registered by phone number on this website.
